## Embedded Systems Projects
A collection of hands-on projects exploring embedded systems, microcontroller programming, and hardware integration. This repository features implementations using Arduino,and other embedded platforms, tackling real-world applications such as sensor interfacing, display control, and efficient algorithm development. Perfect for enthusiasts and engineers looking to deepen their understanding of embedded systems through practical coding and circuit design.

## üöÄ Projects Included:
### Push Button Counter
* Embedded system using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to count button presses.
* Implements software debouncing.
* Count displayed via LCD or serial monitor.

### Bluetooth-Based Home Automation

* Control home appliances using Bluetooth and a mobile app.
* Includes working demo, code, and circuit design.

### Temperature Monitoring System

* Reads temperature data using a sensor (e.g., LM35/DHT11).
* Displays temperature on an LCD or via serial monitor.

### Speech Recognition System

* Command-based device control using basic speech recognition modules (e.g., Voice Recognition V3).
* System design and demo provided.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Components Used:
* Microcontroller Boards: Arduino Uno/Nano
* Sensors & Modules: Push button, DHT11/LM35, HC-05 Bluetooth, Voice Recognition Module
* Display Units: 16x2 LCD, Serial Monitor
* Software: Arduino IDE, Serial Monitor, MIT App Inventor (optional for mobile UI)
* Communication: Bluetooth, Serial Interface

## üìÅ Notes:
* Each project folder contains: source code (.ino), circuit diagram, and README.
* Code is properly commented for clarity.
* Designed using resources such as YouTube tutorials, Google documentation, and ChatGPT guidance.
